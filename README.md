# Module 5

The following skills were used in this module:
- writing recursive functions and using memories
- Using generators.
- Using functions as arguments and using functions in a functional style.
- Using decorators.

## Tasks

### First task
Implement the caching_fibonacci function, which 
creates and uses a cache to store and reuse already 
calculated values of Fibonacci numbers.

### Second task
Create a generator_numbers function that will 
analyze the text, identify all real numbers that 
are considered parts of the income, and return 
them as a generator.

### The third task 
Develop a script to analyze log files. The script can read a log file passed as a command line argument and display statistics by logging level, for example, INFO, ERROR, DEBUG. The user can also specify the logging level as the second command line argument to get all the records of this level.
Example inputs:

`
python task3.py logfile.log
`

`
python task3.py logfile.log error
`
### Fourth task
The console bot assistant from modul 4 task 4 has been modified to handle errors with the help of decorators.
